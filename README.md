## Contribution Guidelines

### Building Robot Code

To help ensure that any changes you make to the code are viable and match format standards, please build your code.

Here are the summarized steps:
1. Right click the build.gradle file
2. Press Build code

Do note that we are using the spotless formatter to format our code. If your build fails because of this, run: `./gradlew spotlessApply` in a terminal pointed to the robot project directory to fix this.
